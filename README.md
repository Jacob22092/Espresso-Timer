## 🚀 What is this?

Ever wanted to brew the perfect espresso shot? This timer helps you nail that perfect 25-second extraction with:

- **Visual coffee machine animation** that fills as you brew
- **Real-time extraction data** (flow rate, weight, ratio)
- **Professional timing phases** (pre-infusion → extraction → finish)
- **Glass morphism UI** that looks like it belongs in a modern coffee shop

## ⚡ Quick Start

**No installation needed!** Just three files:

1. Save the HTML code as `index.html`
2. Save the CSS code as `style.css` 
3. Save the JavaScript code as `script.js`
4. Open `index.html` in any browser
5. Start brewing perfect espresso! ☕

## 🎯 How to Use

**Basic workflow:**
1. **Set your dose** (default: 18g coffee)
2. **Adjust brew time** (default: 25 seconds)
3. **Hit "Start Brewing"** (or press spacebar)
4. **Watch the magic** - coffee streams into cup with real crema formation
5. **Get perfect extraction data** in real-time

**Pro tips:**
- Use `Space` to start/pause quickly
- `Ctrl+R` to reset everything
- Watch the progress ring change colors as time runs out
- Three phases guide you: Pre-infusion → Main Extraction → Finish

## 🛠️ What's Under the Hood

**Tech stack:**
- Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (no frameworks!)
- GSAP for smooth animations
- Anime.js for UI transitions
- Responsive design (works on phone, tablet, desktop)

**Features:**
- ⏱️ Millisecond-accurate timing
- ☕ Realistic coffee machine with animated crema
- 📊 Live flow rate and weight tracking
- 🎨 Glass morphism UI with backdrop blur
- 📱 Mobile-friendly responsive layout
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts for barista workflow

## 🎨 Customization

Want to change colors? Edit the CSS variables:

:root {
    --primary: #3b82f6;        /* Main blue */
    --coffee-dark: #2d1b14;    /* Coffee color */
    --crema: #e5a572;          /* Crema foam */
}

Want faster animations? Adjust the JavaScript timings:

// Make coffee fill faster
duration: 15,  // instead of 18

## 📊 What Makes It Special

Unlike other timers, this one:
- **Shows actual coffee extraction** with realistic crema that sits on top
- **Tracks three distinct phases** with different flow rates
- **Calculates ratios automatically** (1:2 default, but customizable)
- **Changes colors** as time runs critical
- **Looks professional** - could be used in an actual coffee shop

## 🔮 Future Ideas

Some cool features I'm thinking about:
- **Brew history** to track your shots over time
- **Sound alerts** for phase changes
- **Different coffee recipes** (ristretto, lungo, etc.)
- **Temperature simulation** for complete realism
- **Export data** to analyze your brewing patterns

## ☕ Coffee Science

**Perfect espresso guidelines:**
- **18-20g dose** for double shot
- **25-30 seconds** extraction time  
- **1:2 ratio** (18g coffee → 36g espresso)
- **9 bars pressure** at 93-96°C

**Troubleshooting:**
- Too fast? Grind finer
- Too slow? Grind coarser
- Sour? Extract longer or hotter
- Bitter? Extract shorter or cooler
